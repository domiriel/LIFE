# LIFE
## Lifelogging recording format 

This repository contains the most up-to-date specification for the LIFE format. This format is intended to be used in 
Lifelogging applications to record personally relevant semantic information about a user's location and travels throughout
time. It has provisions for different timezones, tagging, annotations, sub-places, etc.

It includes `life.py`, a python script that provides parsing capabilities for LIFE files, for convenience.
