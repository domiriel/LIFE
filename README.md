# LIFE - Lifelogging recording format 

This repository contains the most up-to-date specification for the LIFE format (`life.md`). This format is intended to be used in 
Lifelogging applications to record personally relevant semantic information about a user's location and travels throughout
time. It has provisions for different timezones, tagging, annotations, sub-places, etc.

LIFE files are meant to be both human- and machine-readable and editable. They scale well for a number of different use cases, 
where the users may wat to record more or less information about their lives.

It includes `life.py`, a python script that provides parsing capabilities for LIFE files, for convenience. Its use fairly straightforward by we'll get more detailed instructions here soon.
